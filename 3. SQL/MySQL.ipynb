    "**What is a Database?**\n",
    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that allows efficient retrieval, management, and manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of Databases (Relational, NoSQL, etc.)**\n",
    "- Relational Databases: These databases store data in tables with rows and columns, using structured relationships to maintain data integrity.\n",
    "  Examples : MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.\n",
    "- NoSQL Databases: These databases use a flexible, schema-less data model, suitable for handling unstructured or semi-structured data. Types include document databases (MongoDB), key-value stores (Redis), and graph databases (Neo4j).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is SQL (Structured Query Language)?**\n",
    "SQL is a domain-specific language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. It provides a standardized way to interact with databases, enabling users to define, retrieve, update, and manipulate data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Role of SQL in Database Management**\n",
    "SQL serves several key roles in database management:\n",
    "- Data Definition: Creating and modifying database structures (tables, indexes, constraints).\n",
    "- Data Manipulation: Inserting, updating, and deleting data records.\n",
    "- Data Querying: Retrieving data using SELECT statements and filtering criteria.\n",
    "- Data Control: Defining user permissions, security, and access control."

    "# Indexing in Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Indexing is a technique that significantly improves query performance by facilitating fast data retrieval.\n",
    "- It provides an organized way to access records based on specific column values.\n",
    "- Indexing enables efficient searches and reduces the need for full table scans.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Telephone Directory**\n",
    "- Think of indexing like a telephone directory, where names are alphabetically ordered, enabling quick lookups.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Primary Key (PK) and Unique Constraints:**\n",
    "- Primary key (PK) ensures each record is unique and not null.\n",
    "- Unique constraint allows null values but enforces uniqueness.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Index Types:**\n",
    "- PK and unique constraints can serve as indexes.\n",
    "- Indexing is optional, and if not specified, no indexing occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Default Indexing:**\n",
    "- Clustered Indexing: PK creates original table rearrangement.\n",
    "- Non-clustered Indexing: Unique key creates a separate table referencing original records.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Viewing Indexes:**\n",
    "- To see all indexes for a table:\n",
    "  - `SHOW INDEX FROM tableName FROM databaseName;`\n",
    "  - `SHOW INDEX FROM databaseName.tableName;`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multi-column Indexing (Mul):**\n",
    "- \"MUL\" is an abbreviation that stands for \"Multiple\" in the context of database indexes. When you see \"MUL\" in the \"Key\" column of the output from queries like `SHOW INDEX FROM tableName`, it indicates that the corresponding index is created on a non-unique column that allows multiple duplicate values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MUL (Multiple):** It signifies that the indexed column allows duplicate values. This is in contrast to a \"UNI\" (Unique) index, where the indexed column enforces uniqueness, and duplicate values are not allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In summary, \"MUL\" indicates that an index is created on a column that can have multiple instances of the same value. This type of indexing is useful for optimizing queries that involve searching or filtering based on columns with non-unique values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Creating an Index:**\n",
    "- After table creation - `CREATE INDEX indexName ON tableName(columnName);`\n",
    "- While creating a table:\n",
    "  - Indexing is useful for frequent searches but not for frequent insertions or deletions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Choosing When to Create Indexes:**\n",
    "- Create indexes for columns with a wide range of values.\n",
    "- Use indexes for columns with few null values.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Summary**\n",
    "- Indexing enhances query performance for search-heavy operations.\n",
    "- It provides a structured way to access records based on column values.\n",
    "- Properly chosen indexes can speed up searches while excessive indexing may impact insertions and deletions."
